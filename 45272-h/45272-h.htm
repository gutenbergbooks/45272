<h1><i>Nine O'Clock Talks</i></h1>

Chaplain to Episcopal Students in

<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p><em>These short sermons by the Chaplain
to Episcopalian Students in
Cambridge are collected here for their
interest to Christians of all ages and as a
reminder of the important religious work
being carried on in colleges. It is a truism
that the years of college are crucial for
students; it is then that their interests become
clear and the direction of their life's
work takes shape. But for Christians, education
involves more than the training
of the mind and the acquisition of knowledge;
it involves, like every other phase
of life, enlistment of the will and dedication
of the spirit. Awareness of this fact
has given rise increasingly in recent years
to questions concerning the proper place
of religious teaching in the secular modern
college and university. Without
entering on that question here, one may
be quite certain that a chief force in the
religious life of students will always be</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<em>associations for devotion and discussion
such as those conducted by Mr. Kellogg
under the auspices of the Bishop Rhinelander
Memorial for Student Work.
During his nearly ten years of service he
has influenced by precept and example
literally thousands of students. These
sermons thus carry a double meaning.
In addition to their own high value as
Christian interpretations, they are tokens
of a necessary work to be done.</em></p>

<h2>"<em>In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth.</em>"</h2>


<p>So the Bible opens, so the world
began. The historian, Arnold Toynbee,
has shown us how many beginnings
there have been since that time, how
kingdoms rise and fall, one civilization
succeeding another as new life and inspiration
take the place of death and
complacency. There never will be an
end of beginnings or of ends so long as
the world endures.</p>

<p>A study of this historical cycle shows
that mankind has never lost its hope for
a deus ex machina, a God who will save
men at the last moment from the effects
of their own bad beginnings. It makes a
good story to tell how the Gods from
Olympus intervened on the behalf of
their favorites on the plains of Troy but
it is disastrous when men mistake this
day-dream for reality. Yet at the end of
each age there is to be seen a frantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
scrambling for divine favor, a scurrying
to the churches when the Goths threatened
the Roman Empire, for example,
or a bull market for indulgences as the
Renaissance replaced medieval society.</p>

<p>Men are forever trying to substitute
faith in a last resort God for faith in the
"beginning God".</p>

<p>But seldom if ever has the substitution
been successful. Once an avalanche of
events has been loosed by the criminality
or carelessness of men, God will not
intervene until the tumult and the shouting
have died down, and his still small
voice can once more be heard.</p>

<p>No one can mistake the fact that we
are at the beginning of a new era now,
an era in which events will happen more
quickly and more drastically than in
any period in history. And these events
may be either for good or for evil depending
upon whether we decide now
to follow the "beginning God" rather
than to postpone our faith until fear impels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
a grasping for a God of last resort,
a deus ex machina which does not exist.</p>

<p>To follow the true God, however,
the God who is in the beginning, means
a sharp change in policy; it means
junking our old habits of procrastination
and reliance upon self while the
going is good, for then is the time that inexorable
events pile up to avalanche proportions.
It means starting right now to
refer our decisions to him for advice
with confidence in his universal judgment
and never-ceasing care.</p>

<p>A great opportunity is open to us, for
I do not doubt that the first really successful
age will take place when God is
invited to enter the human scene at the
very outset and thereby to form the pattern
for the years that follow. It is a
crucial opportunity, for the neighborliness
and love that proceed from him are
no longer optional courses but are the
very conditions of survival.</p>

<p>Why not therefore make up our minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
now that we will do everything in our
power this year, this month, today, to
introduce the God of the beginning to
the problems of the now?</p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S</h2>


<p>If you ever examine the early Chinese
vases in the Fogg Museum or elsewhere,
you will note that many of them
have little cracks in the glaze which run
every whichway. You might conclude
that these were caused by antique methods
of firing the pottery, or are just the
result of old age. Actually these cracks,
which are known as crackle in the glaze,
were made on purpose. For it seems that
these vases were often given as New
Year's presents, and since New Year's is
celebrated by the Chinese in the spring,
the crackle was made to represent the
breaking-up of the ice on the rivers and
lakes, the change from the hard and fastness
of winter to the movement of spring.</p>

<p>We miss something important in our
symbolic thinking by not celebrating
Christmas and New Year's at a time
when nature herself takes a new lease on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
life. It is more difficult for us to realize
the possibility of the breaking up of the
old and the forming of the new when
the ice is thickening on the ponds and
the snow is driving deeper on the hills.
It is hard enough as it is to become renewed
in the spirit of our minds.</p>

<p>We try instead to capture newness by
thinking of a child, a symbolic child
that appears on the covers of the Saturday
Evening Post and the Ladies' Home
Journal. Dressed in the scantiest of clothing,
his chubby face covered with a
broad grin, the spirit of the New Year
ushers us into a new calendar. And in
the hurry and excitement of the time it
may have slipped our minds that only a
week before we recalled a real child, a
child that once was born in fact and ever
since has been reborn in the souls of men.</p>

<p>I wonder if we ever associate these
two children and ponder the meaning of
each, for in a way they have a joint significance.
The child of New Year's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
means new opportunities, new openings
for a world of men sick and tired of the
old. Those who would live by this child
alone, however, soon run into depressing
frustration for they have forgotten
that new things do not come easily to old
men&mdash;men that are old in spirit of whatever
age. They find that new opportunities
can only be met and made use of
by people who have a spring of newness
within them; they realize that here is
where newness counts most, down at the
depths of the soul. And perhaps they
discover&mdash;God grant that they do for
it is the greatest discovery that a man can
make&mdash;perhaps they discover that this
is the meaning of the child of a week
before.</p>

<p>Those old words about dying to sin
and rising to newness of life, of being
born again like Nicodemus, or at least
the reality within those words, may of a
sudden catch hold of a man and shake
him to the core&mdash;shake out the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
egocentric habits, break up the shoddy
ways of thinking, that he may be regenerate
and born anew of the Christ within
him.</p>

<p>We are reminded annually on Christmas
Day that a new creature is possible,
a new creature with fresh reactions and
an unburdened soul. We are reminded
of this every time we come to the Holy
Communion and hear Christ's words,
"Come unto me all ye that travail and
are heavy laden and I will refresh you."</p>

<p>But response may be withheld and the
opportunity passes us by. W.H. Auden
states the only too often repeated case in
his <em>Christmas Oratorio</em>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Once again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in previous years we have seen the actual Vision and failed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do more than entertain it as an agreeable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possibility, once again we have sent Him away,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Begging though to remain His disobedient servant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The promising child who cannot keep His word for long."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>That is one possibility, merely to regard
the child of Christmas as a symbol,
like the child of New Year's&mdash;two fabulous
children who have no meaning
once the holiday season is past. Or we
can see in one Child the very reality of
newness, a newness that we can have
and use for this New Year's and every
New Year's to come&mdash;the spirit of God,
eternally new.</p>

<h2>"<em>For we have seen his star in the East
and are come to worship him.</em>"</h2>


<p>But stars that lead travellers in a
fixed direction and then come and
stand over houses cannot be identified
astronomically&mdash;so might comment a
pedestrian critic of the story of the Three
Wise Men. Furthermore, the Magi if
they ever did in fact exist were nothing
but Babylonian priests that were versed
in astrology. Astrology! we all know
that scientific astronomy has long since
relegated that superstitious practice to
the archives of the fantastic.</p>

<p>Yet I wonder if one of the deepest
troubles of our time is that men do not
see stars that lead travellers in a fixed direction.
Is not the Day of the Lord long
overdue when, as he said through the
prophet Joel, "It shall come to pass that
I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh,
and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy, your old men shall dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
dreams, your young men shall see visions."</p>

<p>Visions of peace and a world made
new&mdash;what greater need today has the
strife-ridden world than this?</p>

<p>It may be just poetic fancy in the
Epiphany season that points to a striking
resemblance between the Three
Wise Men following a star to the birthplace
of the Prince of Peace and the
delegates to the assembly of the United
Nations coming from distant lands to
try and make their dream of peace come
true. They have seen the star at last, they
have followed it to the resting place&mdash;so
far all is well. But will they go through
with the whole story?</p>

<p>Have they come primarily to get or to
give? Will the actions of each nation be
governed purely by self-interest, to gain
security, to insure colonial possessions, to
learn new secrets of power for national
aggrandizement? or will they instead,
open their treasures and present unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
him who is none other than the spirit of
world brotherhood their gifts&mdash;one gold,
another frankincense, another myrrh?
For they have much to offer, ancient
culture, glorious traditions, scientific
knowledge, vast resources both material
and spiritual, all things that can be
used for the unlimited good of all if
shared, but which if hoarded, and thus
envied, can work their utter destruction.</p>

<p>Will they come in a spirit of humility
or will they come with pride in their own
might and sovereignty? The Magi were
wise enough to fall down and worship
the Prince of Peace even though he was
only just born. Are the nations equally
wise to recognize the presence of embryonic
peace and see in it greater import,
greater worth, than in anything each one
singly has to offer?</p>

<p>Have they the courage of their convictions?
It will be so today as it was
before: "When Herod the King had
heard these things he was troubled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
all Jerusalem with him." The powers of
isolationism, in all its forms of non-cooperation,
suspicion, financial reaction,
will be sorely troubled by the Prince of
Peace and will do all in their power to
kill him while still a child. And they will
use all the deception that Herod employed:
"Go and search diligently for
the young child and when you have
found him bring me word again that I
may come and worship him also." Go
and find out all you can about the intents
and operations of the other nations so
that we can use them to our advantage.
Go and expose the futility of cooperation.
Go make mistakes so that we can
repudiate our delegates and once more
return to reliance upon self and national
security.</p>

<p>Finally, will they depart into their
own country another way or will they
return to Herod? Nor will it be of any
more use than it was with the old League
of Nations if when they return they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
not lead the fight at home to mobilize
the forces for peace in their own countries
rather than compromise with Herod.
This of course they cannot do unless
they have the determined support of
every one of us. We must not only be
ready to receive them with eagerness but
we must meanwhile be following the
same star as best we can, seeing the same
visions, learning how to give and not
just to get, practicing the same humility,
exerting the same courage of our convictions.
World peace cannot be accomplished
merely by delegates any more
than the Prince of Peace could reign
with the help of three wise men alone.</p>

<h2>"<em>Then was Jesus led up of the spirit
into the wilderness to be tempted of the
devil.</em>"</h2>


<p>Let no one think for a moment that
the devil is a fool. He used the same
ingenuity with our Lord that he has
shown from the day that Adam fell to
the present time. And one of his favorite
methods of attack reveals itself here&mdash;he
waits until a man is in a spiritual wilderness
before he presents the greatest temptation,
for he knows that it is in loneliness
that most people succumb.</p>

<p>The temptation may be the one which
our Lord faced&mdash;to try to achieve spiritual
ends by worldly means. Or it may
be less subtle&mdash;to give in to degrading
thoughts or actions. In whichever one
of the infinite forms the enticement of
the devil may appear, we are most vulnerable
when cut off from companionship.</p>

<p>It is possible to be a romantic about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
temptation, to take the attitude of Kipling's
poem "If", to glory in your own
self-sufficiency when all about you are
losing their heads. Or one can be a Stoic
and grimly bear the vicissitudes of life
by oneself, scorning the assistance of
others as a sign of weakness.</p>

<p>But the Christian solution is otherwise.
It points out that the fight with temptation
is generally a negative affair, a rear
guard action. What we want to discover
is the most efficient method of overcoming
it in order to be set free for more
positive and fruitful work. And the plain
fact is that temptation can best be overcome
with the help of others. To resist
this assistance in time of need is not a
virtue but a form of spiritual pride.
When we pray "Lead us not into temptation"
we mean at least in part, don't let
the devil get us off by ourselves, for he
has an easy time picking off stragglers.
But he is completely frustrated by men
and women who hold together in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
bond of fellowship and understanding.</p>

<p>The very same thing is true of suffering.
Indeed there is a close connection
between the two. There is acute suffering
in resisting temptation. And there is
temptation in the endurance of suffering&mdash;temptation
to wallow in self-pity and
despair. It may be that misery loves company
for its own sake, but it is equally
the case that suffering can best be dealt
with in the companionship of others.
Why is it that such extraordinary acts of
fortitude in plain can take place in wartime?
Why?&mdash;because men are fighting
side by side and are upheld by the esprit
de corps that is generated by a common
struggle.</p>

<p>What has all this got to do with us,
you may wonder. We don't have any
temptations that seem too great to handle
by ourselves, nor do we have to endure
intense suffering. Perhaps so, but
the chances are that we won't always be
so fortunate and we can never tell when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
it may happen. If we don't learn how
to handle the present smaller trials and
temptations we may be overcome by the
larger ones when they come.</p>

<p>So I suggest that you use this Lent to
learn some lessons. And the first lesson
is to realize your common humanity&mdash;to
perceive how valuable people are to
you and you to them. In the time of
temptation and suffering you will not
hesitate to turn to others if you have
made a practice of being close to others
when the going is good.</p>

<p>Remember too that by overcoming
trouble in your own life you gain new
and great powers to help others through
their dark periods. You then have sympathy
and understanding of a kind which
alone comes from suffering and you have
the fibre of victory that comes only from
the transcending of temptation.</p>

<p>Finally, realize the constant presence
of God. He will be your companion
even when all else fails:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If I climb up into heaven thou art there<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I go down to hell thou are there also.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I take the wings of the morning and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even there also shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Temptation and suffering cannot be
avoided but they can be beaten by you
and through you in the company of your
fellow men and with the upholding presence
of God.</p>

<h2>PALM SUNDAY</h2>


<p>When Jesus rode into Jerusalem
on the first Palm Sunday he must
have been in great suspense. Would he
be recognized in his true colors? Jesus
came as king, but not the kind of king
the people expected. Would the real
meaning of his entrance into the city be
recognized or would he again be misunderstood
as he had been so often before,
even by his closest friends?</p>

<p>The crucial question was one of recognition.
Would the real meaning be
seen, would the signs be read aright.</p>

<p>That is why Jesus spoke with such
concern about signs and the way they
should be read. "Now learn a parable of
the fig tree," he said, "when his branch
is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you
know that summer is nigh." Signs like
that in nature are unmistakable. But
when it comes to sizing up a man and his
meaning they are far more complex.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Then real perception must be used, "for
there shall arise false Christs and false
prophets and shall shew great signs and
wonders insomuch that if it were possible
they shall deceive the very elect." How
many of us spoke enthusiastically of
Mussolini because Italian trains began
running on time and beggars disappeared
from the steps of cathedrals? How many
good people were duped by Franco
merely because he proclaimed allegiance
to the church and Christianity? How
many well meaning people are fooled by
the devil in all his guises?</p>

<p>And the reverse side of the picture has
its equally discouraging aspects. Great
men live and die, unrecognized and misunderstood.
Men of good will are persecuted
and put to death. The greatest
and best of all men rode into Jerusalem
and in less than a week he was hanging
from a cross. The perversity of the human
race seems equalled only by its
foolishness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The inhabitants of Jerusalem could at
least plead ignorance. The signs of the
meaning of Jesus were not obvious.
True, the prophet had written before
in the Book of Zechariah to be on the
watch for such an event. "Rejoice greatly,
O daughter of Zion, shout O daughter
of Jerusalem. Behold, thy king cometh
unto thee; he is just and having salvation;
lowly and riding upon an ass, and upon
a colt the foal of an ass."</p>

<p>Jesus acquiesced in this prophetic
symbolism and some did recognize him
for what he was&mdash;the spiritual King, the
Messiah of God. A few but only a few
saw the meaning of the signs.</p>

<p>But since that time how can man plead
ignorance? The gospel has been preached
in every nation of the world and has
been written in a thousand languages.
Basilicas, cathedrals, and monasteries
have glorified him in wood and stone.
The greatest artists have painted him,
the greatest authors have written about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
him. And yet if Christ came again to
one of the modern Jerusalems would the
effects be much different even though
we have had two thousand years to learn
of him and know his ways? We have
proclaimed the magnificence of our reception
but have we ever really received
him? Could he not say the same thing
in truth as he beheld the city and wept
over it: "if thou hadst known, even thou
at least in this thy day, the things which
belong unto thy peace." He would stand
about the same chance of recognition as
King today as he did then, for we too
are looking in the wrong direction. They
looked for a mighty man at the head of
an army or a political party. We look
for a Christ in pomp and circumstance
in power and great glory. Perhaps then
on this Palm Sunday we should try looking
in the place where he was found
before, and will always be found. Quietly
waiting outside the city of our hearts,
waiting for our recognition and acceptance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
"Behold, thy king cometh unto
thee; he is just and having salvation;
lowly and riding upon an ass, and upon
a colt the foal of an ass."</p>

<h2>EASTER</h2>


<p>Christ the Lord is risen today.
Alleluia! The purple veil is lifted
from the Cross, the Altar, bare through
Lent, is now adorned with flowers, for
the agony of Good Friday has given way
to the rejoicing of the Resurrection.
Joyful people crowd the churches to
proclaim the yearly rediscovered fact
that Christ has opened the way through
darkness into light and has turned man's
sorrow into gladness. Christ the Lord is
risen today. Alleluia.</p>

<p>But for the thoughtful, I wonder if
there isn't another theme that runs in
a minor key throughout the Easter
music. I wonder if Easter isn't for many
a day of joyous farewells. Christ has
risen to sit at the right hand of the throne
of God and we glory in that fact; but
don't we feel like saying with Thomas,
"Lord, we know not whither thou goest
and how can we know the way." There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
may be many mansions in the house of
God but they seem so very remote. Even
our Lord's assurance that he is the way,
the truth and the life does not quite fill
the place in our hearts left hollow by his
departure.</p>

<p>For forty days and nights he has
been among us sharing our humanity,
its problems and its pains. He has been
with us in anxiety, in sleeplessness, in
sorrow. He has been so human, indeed,
that we have forgotten his descent. We
are not prepared to lose our old familiar
friend.</p>

<p>It may be that in normal times, by
which we mean in thoughtless times, his
absence is not greatly felt or is soon forgotten.
But who is there among us now
that does not feel the burden of human
war and peace? Who is there that has
not needed friendship to take the place
of loss, that has not looked for counsel
and strength beyond the limits of his
own life?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>And for these, the Lord has been a
present help in time of trouble. He has
been a man among men, by our side, to
lead us on our way.</p>

<p>Now Easter comes, our Lord has risen.
Christ has become King, a God of
Gods. Yet here we remain, we haven't
changed, our problems are the same, our
needs the same.</p>

<p>"Love's redeeming work is done,
fought the fight the battle won," we
sing. But there is still the overtone of
sadness in the Easter music which might
even become a note of irony. Love's
work is done? The battle won? Not in
our world it isn't, far from it. We'd
better postpone Easter till better times
are come. Lent has meaning now, one
long unswerving Lent, with discipline
and hard work.</p>

<p>But wait a moment. We see the veil
is lifted from the Cross this Easter day,
and now the cross stands clear and shadowless
upon the Altar. Does that signify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the end of suffering, or is there here an
Easter meaning for these times more
potent and impelling than ever Lent has
brought? It is said that Constantine the
Great, returning from his victory over
Maxentius, saw in the sky these words,
"In hoc signo vinces," and thereafter he
placed the Cross upon his standard. The
cross is brighter still on Easter for it is
an earnest that yet again through its sign
we shall conquer.</p>

<p>The cross reminds us too that though
he is risen, he is in no way further from
us than before. He still bears upon himself
the marks of the cross&mdash;the marks
of Lent made meaningful by Easter.</p>

<p>The cross has by no means disappeared,
rather it has been vindicated,
death has not vanished but it has been
overcome, suffering will continue but it
can be transformed. Let us then rejoice
and be exceeding glad this Easter of all
Easters for the way of the cross has
proved to be the way of Life and Victory.</p>

<h2>"<em>But the comforter, which is the
Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send
in my name, he shall teach you all things,
and bring all things to your remembrance.</em>"</h2>


<p>Canon Quick of Durham wrote
a most thought-provoking paragraph
in his book <cite>Doctrines of the
Creed</cite>. "One essential paradox of Christianity,"
he wrote, "consists in the fact
that, although when viewed from outside
it is one of the religions of the world,
when it is known from within it is not a
religion at all, nor even the true religion
only, but something inherently more
than religion; it is a whole social life of
Communion in God among men, a communion
which embraces both sacred and
secular activities and is altogether transfigured
by the pervading presence of
God's love."</p>

<p>And what gives Christianity this extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
combination of breadth and
depth is the event of Whitsunday&mdash;the
coming of the Holy Spirit. As St. John
says, "the Holy Spirit will teach you all
things"&mdash;that is the breadth&mdash;and will
"bring all things to your remembrance"
about the earthly life and teaching of
Christ&mdash;that is the depth.</p>

<p>All through Christian history, but
particularly today, two opposing tendencies
can be seen at work. One is the
desire to liberalize Christianity and make
it more inclusive. Some, noting the good
in out of the way places&mdash;there is honesty
among thieves and there is sincerity
among atheists, would push Christianity
to a point where it would include all
good wherever found and in whatever
combination. The logical conclusion
would be to turn it into a kind of pantheism&mdash;a
catch-all for all truth, goodness,
and beauty. A good Buddhist is
really a good Christian whether he
knows it or not, they would say, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the fact that he would be considerably
annoyed to be told so.</p>

<p>In this drive to be comprehensive, the
specific doctrines of the church would
have to be scrapped or soft-pedalled
and the emphasis be put upon right living,
whatever that is.</p>

<p>If you feel at this point like smiling in
superior fashion at these liberalizers, examine
your own mind for a moment and
see if at least part of you doesn't agree
with this. For example, have you ever
felt or said about so-and-so who is an
agnostic and never darkens the door of
a church, that he is a better Christian
than you, since he is more generous,
more courageous, more generally virtuous?
And this you say, not out of humility,
but from a suspicion that he is
in better touch with the source of goodness
than you are.</p>

<p>And I could go on to point out other
reasons why we would like to extend
the label of Christianity as far as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>But the opposite tendency is also
strong within us. Make Christianity
precise, define carefully its limits and
make membership within it rigorous and
single-minded. I heard of a clergyman,
who when asked how his congregation
was doing, replied, "Fine-thinning 'em
out, thinning 'em out."</p>

<p>We are aware of the strength that lies
in narrowness and secretly covet the
simplification and order of an authoritarian
church.</p>

<p>However forceful these opposing tendencies
may be we know at least that
neither one can be allowed to run wild
without disaster to Christianity. There
must be an integrating force that holds
these together and leads to the productiveness
that flows out of the tension
between them.</p>

<p>That force is the Holy Spirit. The
Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father,
through the Son. He always refers back
to Christ as the incarnate center of Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
life, and thence to God who is the
source of the love that binds men into
one communion and fellowship. Confusion
exists because there are many
spirits in the world&mdash;spirits of a nation,
of humanity, of progress. But these are
never to be identified with the Holy
Spirit, who always brings to remembrance
Christ himself, who must become
the corner stone of all life everywhere.
To be apart from him is to be apart from
God. To forget this is the danger of
liberalism.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, the Holy Spirit
will teach you all things, and as Canon
Quick says, "is the moving spirit in the
Communion in God among men, a Communion
which embraces all things both
sacred and secular and cannot be confined
to man-made limitations." In forgetting
this lies the danger of sectarianism.</p>

<p>The work of the Holy Spirit begins
with Christ and continues to the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the earth. That is the spirit we pray for
and can expect to receive on Whitsunday.
Don't be content with anything
less.</p>

<h2>THE BLIND CAN LEAD
THE BLIND</h2>


<p>The story is told of a blind man
who wanted to free himself from
the restrictions of his handicap by going
about without his usual guide. With the
use of a stick, he found he could leave
his house and walk down the street well
enough, but when he came to the crossing
where the cars drove by in unending
stream he could not get himself to start
across, although he knew that the drivers
would almost certainly stop when
they saw him leave the curb. He didn't
quite have the confidence and was turning
back discouraged with himself, when
he felt a hand on his arm, and a voice
said, "May I go across with you?" Reassured,
he and his companion stepped
out into the street, the cars came to a
halt, and they proceeded across safely.
When they got to the far side he was
about to thank his friend, but before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
could do so the other said, "I'm much
obliged to you for your assistance in
crossing the street, for, you see, I'm
blind."</p>

<p>A passage from the Bible comes immediately
to mind, does it not? "And
he spoke a parable unto them, Can the
blind lead the blind, shall they not both
fall into the ditch?" The answer is no,
not necessarily.</p>

<p>Blind men may be excellent guides; it
all depends on where the blindness lies.</p>

<p>Our Lord was warning us of men who
are blind in the eyes of the mind and
spirit. As Marianne Moore wrote in her
poem "In Distrust of Merits":</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Job disheartened by false comfort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">that nothing can be so defeating<br /></span>
<span class="i6">as a blind man who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">can see. O alive who are dead, who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">are proud not to see. O small dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">of the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i6">that walks so arrogantly."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>These are the people to guard against,
the blind who can see.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many men are
coming back from the war who have
lost the sight of their eyes, but it would
be fatal for the world to imagine them all
blind. They have seen and known what
most of us have escaped, the horrors of
war, and it is their compelling experience
that we need to help fight against the
seeds of another war.</p>

<p>Blind men may be excellent guides,
(and in the last analysis aren't we all
blind?) but they also need faith&mdash;they
must have faith in the insights of each
other, they must have confidence that
together they can reach their destination.
The men in the story could not
accomplish what they wanted by themselves
but when they joined forces they
got the necessary confidence to go ahead.
But that's what faith entails. Joining
forces with men who rely primarily on
the eye of the mind and spirit. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that's the faith we all need so desperately
in the days to come.</p>

<p>How far do you think you can get
without the insights and understanding
of others? Look at the past. How much
wisdom have you acquired all by yourself
apart from the experiences of humanity
that you have met in books or
face to face? We are embarked on a
highly cooperative adventure in this life.
Let no man pride himself on his own
ability to reach his destination alone; nor
let him feel a coward for needing the
assistance of others.</p>

<p>Most of us know this well enough at
least in large sections of our living&mdash;our
culture, our business, our enjoyments
are clearly mutual enterprises. Neither
conceit nor ignominy are apt to enter
these, for it is only too obvious how much
we depend upon our fellow humans.</p>

<p>But oddly enough, when it comes to
our religion, where mutual faith becomes
the clearest necessity, that is the point at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which we frequently leave our fellow
blind men and plunge off by ourselves.
Why people suppose that they can find
God, their ultimate destination, by themselves,
is a unique mystery. Why, to put
it more concretely, a man can claim to
have his own religion and not need the
corporate advice and encouragement of
the church can only be understood if he
is content with a fragmentary faith, content
to leave his house, walk down the
sidewalk, but never cross the street to
the other side. That kind of blind man
would indeed fall into the ditch and all
who followed him blindly would end
there too. It all depends upon mutual
faith, mutual confidence in each other.</p>

<p>One of the great pictures by Pieter
Breughel the Elder shows a procession
of blind men entering a river. The casual
observer would suppose that they were
all about to be drowned; that is if he
observed in a superficial way. But the
subtlety and greatness of the picture lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in the fact that that is not the only possible
conclusion. They may be making
their way across. It all depends upon
what is in their minds. They may be
blind, but they may not be following
blindly. They may have the same faith
of the two men in the story that will
bring them safely across.</p>

<p>"And when Jesus departed thence,
two blind men followed him, crying,
and saying, Thou Son of David, have
mercy on us. And when he was come
into the house, the blind men came to
him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe
ye that I am able to do this? They said
unto him, Yea, Lord. Then touched he
their eyes, saying, According to your
faith be it unto you. And their eyes
were opened."</p>

<p>Is it just a coincidence that there were
two blind men in this story and not just
one? Two men who had faith in God
and in each other, and faith that together
they could reach their final destination.</p>

<h2>"<em>If Satan also be divided against himself
how shall his kingdom stand?</em>"</h2>


<p>The answer, of course, is that it
won't stand any more than any
other house. But unfortunately the
forces of evil seem to recognize this fact
more clearly than do the forces of good.
Satan and his followers cling together so
tenaciously because they know what
they want and they realize that they
must be unified in order to get it. Just
compare Germany and France at the beginning
of the war. The Nazis had one
all-consuming aim behind their actions&mdash;to
conquer the world&mdash;and because
of this unity of purpose they came within
a hair's breadth of succeeding. Indeed
they would have done so had it not been
for a unity of desperation forged at the
last moment between vastly stronger nations.
On the other hand, France didn't
begin to know her own mind until it was
too late. Conflicting interests and internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
antagonisms made her a pathetically
easy prey for the invader.</p>

<p>The fact is that the natural tendency
among humans is to differ rather than
to agree. Centrifugal force seems to be
stronger in society than centripetal, and
this is why so many houses are brought
to desolation.</p>

<p>But just because divisiveness is natural,
it does not follow that nothing can be
done to keep men together. It merely
means that unity has constantly to be
made or it will not come about. The
drift is not in that direction. Here is a
place where man must use his freedom
of choice and will, to transcend his inclinations.
Fatalism and unity do not mix.</p>

<p>This being the case, where are man's
unifying efforts particularly needed today?</p>

<p>The area where politics rises above
itself is one of the most crucial for future
world welfare. There are many elements
in politics which are of necessity partisan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and controversial. In fact, His Majesty's
loyal opposition or the equivalent is essential
to progressive government. But
the fundamentals which all should have
in common must not therefore be neglected.
No politician in this country ever
rose to such heights of community understanding
as did Abraham Lincoln,
and the great words he used, "government
of the people, by the people, and
for the people," states clearly that underlying
unity without which democracy
becomes anarchy. But it is not merely
coincidental that this famous phrase
appeared first in the preface that John
Wyclif wrote to his translation of the
Bible. Unity comes from God in the
sense that He wills men to achieve it.</p>

<p>On a national scale partisanship must
not allow another post-war fiasco, and it
is appalling to hear that certain people
are still firmly opposed to a world
organization. On the local scene, religious,
racial and social antagonisms have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
brought about a shameful state in the
educational systems of our cities. Can't
the welfare of our children be a matter
of united action? It must become so.</p>

<p>Our heritage from the reformation is
another value which we are in the process
of losing because of disunity. At a
public hearing in New York City recently
the question came up why certain
individuals had received no attention.
A social worker remarked, "Oh, they
are only P.P.P.s" When asked what this
meant he replied, "Poor, powerless protestants."</p>

<p>Protestant unity is the first step toward
Christian unity and world-wide
religious cooperation. And it takes only
a moment of sober, realistic thought to
see that all Christians have vastly more
in common than they have in particular.
Why not spend more time and thought
rejoicing in and applying the unity that
already exists instead of magnifying our
differences?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>What it all comes down to is an attitude
of mind. Do we try and cultivate
our ability to agree when we can, to see
the scope of our common aims, or are
we consistently developing our divergences?
Take the time to analyze yourself
in this regard. If we take pride in
our contrariness we are playing straight
into the hands of the devil, for he is not
making the mistake of a divided house
himself&mdash;rather he is waiting for us to
fall into that desolation. But if we hold
steadfastly to the implications of the
Christian doctrine of one God and all
men as his equally valuable children, we
are headed for a final victory in world
brotherhood, the place where victory
counts most.</p>

<h2>"<em>Put on the whole armour of God.</em>"</h2>


<p>Very few passages in the Bible are
as well known or as highly esteemed
as this exhortation to stand
against the wiles of the devil. And certainly
it has an immediate bearing today
when the outcome of the battle between
good and evil is crucial for the very existence
of civilization.</p>

<p>But this passage has a potentially misleading
character about it which may
have a disastrous effect upon the waging
of the battle. Much of it sounds purely
defensive. "To withstand in the evil
day", "to quench all the fiery darts of
the wicked"&mdash;the word "armour" even
has the connotation of protection. All
this can easily play into the hands of
those who have the notion that the main
duty of a Christian is to keep himself
unspotted from the world. Like the
three famous monkeys of the East, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no
evil, it is thought that evil itself will
somehow cease to exist if it is merely
avoided. Of course there is some truth
in this point of view in as much as the
Christian must have adequate defensive
equipment, but it must be forever emphasized
that the vital element in the
armour of God is the last one that St.
Paul mentions, namely, the sword of the
Spirit which is the word of God. For
we can be sure that all the breastplates,
helmets, and shields ever made will be
of little effect by themselves in defeating
the principalities, the powers and the
rulers of the darkness of this world.
That is like building a tank of the most
shell-proof armour but not putting in a
powerful engine and a hard hitting gun.
It just won't win battles.</p>

<p>Indeed, the most alarming sign of
these times is the tendency to go onto the
defensive, to try to side-step problems
which appear to be too great to solve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
It is a sign that the end of our era may be
at hand. When the French Army came
to the Marne in its retreat on Paris in
the first world war, defeat seemed imminent.
At that moment General Foch
made his memorable decision. "My center
is giving way, my right is pushed
back&mdash;excellent! I'll attack."</p>

<p>As we know, that attack saved France.
And as we also know, the lack of attack
in this last war brought France's downfall.
Without the sword of the Spirit,
which is the spirit of the offensive, the
most that can be hoped for is that defeat
may be delayed. But it will surely come.</p>

<p>And defeat will surely come to this
nation unless we take the offensive in
solving the titanic problem of power that
we have suddenly found in our hands.
It cannot be hid under a bushel, it cannot
be evaded, it cannot be kept to ourselves.
It must be shared, for that is what the
offensive means in this case&mdash;the exploration
and achievement of new methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of cooperation which have never yet
been tried. Small-minded and fearful
men think only of retreat&mdash;retreat into
self-protection. But the alternative to
one world now is one Hell, or even more
accurately one complete annihilation.</p>

<p>It may seem like an anti-climax to say
that your own personal defeat will come
in the same way if you put your faith in
defensive armour and fail to acquire and
use the sword of the spirit. It may have
been possible in years gone by to live
blandly in the Puritan house on the hill
where all questionable literature was
carefully banned, where temptation was
kept at a minimum; where the turmoil,
poverty and disease of the factory-filled
valley could not be seen. But that is no
longer possible because the ways of the
valley and the hill have met. It never was
Christian, it was merely rationalized
egotism, to escape the problems of evil
and call it purity. The Christian paradox
must never be forgotten that dirty water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
washes clean when used in the service of
God.</p>

<p>The time has come both personally
and nationally to put on the whole armour
of God in order to take the offensive
against the powers of darkness of
this world.</p>

<h2>"<em>How oft shall my brother sin against
me, and I forgive him? Till seven
times?</em>"</h2>


<p>When Peter asked this leading
question he may have been trying
to seem magnanimous. For Jewish
law required only a threefold forgiveness,
after which, apparently, you were
free to take revenge. Our Lord rejected
this whole legalistic approach by his reply
and penetrated, as he always did, to
the inner spirit of the matter. Until
seventy times seven was a traditional way
of saying "without limit." He was trying
to make Peter realize that to attach
numbers to an action of this kind prevents
your heart from being in it. Even
if there were no chance of your brother
sinning against you more than seven
times, you were not really forgiving him
the first time as long as you had a limit
set to the extent of your forgiveness.</p>

<p>The forgiving love of God, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the pattern for the same spirit in man,
has no boundaries, no qualifications.</p>

<p>But hasn't it? you may well ask.
Doesn't the Lord's prayer set a condition
to his forgiveness of trespasses that
we forgive those who trespass against
us? Doesn't the parable of the unmerciful
servant which follows Peter's question
end with the stern "So likewise shall
my heavenly Father do also unto you if
ye from your hearts forgive not everyone
his brother their trespasses."</p>

<p>No, to regard this as a condition to
God's forgiveness is to misunderstand
radically the way God works, to mistake
his very nature. To regard him as a bargainer,
an exchanger of favors, is to descend
to the really false kind of anthropomorphism
which is to impute to him
our weaknesses rather than to find in us
his strength.</p>

<p>God's forgiveness flows from him
continuously. When we do not experience
it, it is because we fail to allow it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
operate. To put the situation in its real
terms, unless we learn to apply the spirit
of forgiveness toward others we can
never expect to discover the meaning of
God's forgiveness in our own lives&mdash;we
can never forgive ourselves; for that is
one step more difficult than forgiving
others. This may sound like nonsense
at first. Difficult to forgive ourselves?
Why that's easy, we reply. We are always
coating over our mistakes, rationalizing
our errors. But don't you see?
In the very use of the words coating over
and rationalizing, we admit that there is
a core of guilt there somewhere that has
not been forgiven but just covered up
temporarily&mdash;and if the truth were
known, allowed to fester and grow till
its effect becomes deadly indeed. If you
don't believe this, explore the inner recesses
of your mind and look for a minute
at the gallery of thoughts and actions
you are trying to forget because they
hurt. They hurt you still because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
have never been touched by God's forgiveness.
You have not learned the spirit
of forgiveness toward others sufficiently
to apply it to yourself.</p>

<p>But suppose you have tried to be forgiving
and found it difficult or well-nigh
impossible. It actually is not an easy
thing to learn. And it cannot be accomplished
merely by saying to oneself in a
stern voice, "Forgive others and forgive
yourself." Much could be said on how
to learn, but one point stands out above
the rest as wise counsel. Look at others
and yourself with a sense of perspective.
Our brother sins against us, the magnifying
glass is brought out and focussed
upon that sin, and our brother appears
entirely sinful. We ourselves commit a
sin, the microscope is turned upon that
spot in us, and all our good seems evil in
its darkness. Learn to take away the
magnification as soon as the trouble is
sufficiently examined. See again the good
which greatly outweighs the evil, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
that good is the light in which forgiveness
thrives.</p>

<p>"How oft shall I or my brother sin
against me, and I forgive him?" I hope
you know by now.</p>

<h2>"<em>For our citizenship is in Heaven.</em>"</h2>


<p>One of the greatest works on the
philosophy of history is St. Augustine's
<cite>City of God</cite>. Though written in
the dark days after the sack of Rome by
the Goths, it has perhaps an even more
immediate bearing upon these brighter
times because it is now that we are in the
greatest danger of taking a nationally
self-sufficient view of history.</p>

<p>St. Augustine saw that a Christian is a
citizen of two worlds&mdash;the Earthly City
and the City of God. These two cities
have been formed by two loves: the
earthly, by love of self even to the contempt
of God; the Heavenly, by the love
of God even to the contempt of self.
The earthly city is the state, and although
it is a relative good, it must exist
to maintain civil order in a sinful world.
The city of God is the ultimate good
where man's highest loyalty must reside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
for as St. Paul pointed out, our true
citizenship is in Heaven.</p>

<p>Our Lord himself recognized this
double responsibility of man when he
told the Pharisees "to render unto Caesar
the things which are Caesar's and unto
God the things which are God's." This
shouldn't be too hard to comprehend,
and yet history reveals the repeated error
and tragedy of man's desire to be a
citizen of one world or the other, but
not both. Perhaps the difficulty lies in
the fact that citizenship itself is a two-fold
affair. It involves one's allegiance
to a state and it also entitles the citizen
to the protection of that state. It may be,
therefore, that a double allegiance is too
much for most men to bear, or it may be
that the protection of the earthly state
seems so much more tangible. In any
event, the "either-or-ness" has been most
unfortunate in its consequences.</p>

<p>To be a citizen of Heaven alone is
more difficult for the average American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to understand. Few men these days are
tempted to go off into the desert and live
an other-worldly life in prayer and contemplation
with the sole desire of saving
their own souls. And yet a more subtle
form of this escapism is the chief object
of the attack made by politically liberal
and radical groups upon Christianity.
Socialists and Communists have with
good reason charged that much of every
man's Christianity is a Sunday escapism
with little or no effect upon his daily
living, unrelated to his civic responsibilities
and to existing evils.</p>

<p>Bad as this may be, the opposite form
of single statism would seem to be more
devastating in our present situation.
When Stephen Decatur made his famous
toast to "Our Country, in her intercourse
with foreign nations may she always be
in the right, but our country, right or
wrong," he revealed the stupid tragedy
of all the many forms of the American
First principle. But he incidentally admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the existence and necessity of a
superior standard of judgment by which
the nation is seen to be either right or
wrong. Unless our citizenship is in
Heaven we cannot be effective and reliable
citizens of this country or any
country on earth. All we are fitted for
without it is to be slaves to a Fascist state,
saluting and goose-stepping moronically
at the command of a self-appointed leader.
We must have a basis for judging
even our own country and our most
honored institutions.</p>

<p>This nation is in the midst of the most
important decisions any people on earth
have ever faced. If we make them as
members of the Earthly City alone,
which as St. Augustine said is formed by
love of self even to the contempt of God,
we or our descendants will witness the
final form of uncritical patriotism: the
end of our state in the end of all civilization.
But if those in authority, pressed
on by us, will recognize their ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
allegiance to the City of God which
transcends all national sovereignty and
boundaries there is good hope that the
decision will be made for the good of all
mankind and not simply for our destruction.</p>

<p>If they or we are fearful in this fatal
moment, we might remember the other
side of citizenship&mdash;as members of the
City of God we are also entitled to its
protection and its power.</p>

<p>Remember the experience of Elisha
and his servant. And Elisha prayed and
said, "Lord, I pray thee open his eyes
that he may see. And then the Lord
opened the eyes of the young man and
he saw, And behold the mountain was
full of horses and chariots of fire round
about Elisha."</p>

<h2>"<em>Forgetting those things which are
behind and reaching forth unto those
things which are before.</em>"</h2>


<p>One might well assume that these
words of St. Paul are an accepted
part of all theories of progress; looking
forward instead of backward. But Lewis
Mumford in his book <cite>The Condition of
Man</cite> points out that this has unfortunately
not always been the case, to the
confusion and sidetracking of mankind's
efforts. Progress, he says, may be considered
in either of two ways&mdash;getting
closer to a goal, or getting farther away
from a starting point. And it was in the
latter sense that the exponents of progress
in the era of Romanticism; Hume,
Voltaire, and the others, preached it&mdash;the
casting loose from a past crippled by
evils: brutality, superstition, ignorance,
misery.</p>

<p>But have these curses disappeared
from the earth? Have they not in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
respects grown worse? I am afraid so,
and I think it is due in large part to this
negative theory of progress which has
possessed man since the Renaissance.
The intended cures of evils have been
too often sought purely as an escape
from the evil itself and not with a view
to ultimate good.</p>

<p>Serfdom and slavery were evil, so men
broke away and became free; but free
for what? That was of little consequence
as long as they were free. The Germans
felt the pressure of other nations around
them so they needs must make more
Lebensraum&mdash;room in which to be free.
And what nation has ever become so enslaved
in the process? We didn't want
war, and so with the mounting fear of
war before our eyes, we temporized until
the greatest war in history came upon
us. An individual realizes how great is
his own selfishness and so to overcome
it, he concentrates upon self-centered
cure and becomes even more entangled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>No, this kind of progress is no progress
at all, but rather a circle back into
greater evil. Man was not made to run
with his eyes turned backward. He will
inevitably fall into the same or deeper pit.</p>

<p>The only true and effective kind of
progress is progress toward a goal with
that goal clearly and constantly before
our eyes.</p>

<p>We want peace. What then is peace?
It certainly is not the mere avoidance of
war. It is rather the achievement of those
conditions which allow for men's dependance
upon each other with greater
mutual respect and affection.</p>

<p>We want internal national harmony.
Does that come from the suppression of
the demands of labor or the abolition of
the guidance of management? Certainly
not. It comes from a joint appreciation
of the values of living without which
there is no possible common ground.</p>

<p>Do you as an individual want to grow
in wisdom and stature? Yes, certainly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
But that will not come from mere reaction
to your past; although that is a delusion
under which many men labor.
This frequently reveals itself in their
attitude toward religion. Almost everyone
goes through a period of reaction
against religion and all that it stands for.
It usually happens about Sophomore
year in college. Actually it is a reaction
against the authority of our parents, our
school teachers and our unthinking past
in general. It is necessary for each one
to think out his purposes and goals, his
religion for himself, or else it will never
have his whole hearted support. But because
of this confusion between authority
and religion many people reject both
together and forever after are motivated
by reactions and not by any real positive
ideal. They are the followers of the illusory
theory of progress and are forever
in frustration.</p>

<p>No, if you would make real progress
you must start as soon as possible disentangling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
your ultimate ends from your
reaction to your beginnings; keeping
what is true for you and discarding what
is false. Once this process is begun, it
must be continued and developed until
you have a religion that really pulls you
on, until you are reaching forth unto
those things which are before, until you
have found the God who is your God
and in whom you live and move and
have your being.</p>
